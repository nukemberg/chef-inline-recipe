# inline\_recipe cookbook
This cookbook provides the `inline_recipe` resource which allows you to run an inline recipe as a resource.
This gives the ability to run resources as an atomic group without creating LWRPs.
The main purpose of this cookbook is to demonstrate the power and ease of new LWRP internals.

# Usage
Have a look at the default recipe, it's fairly simple.

# Recipes
inline\_recipe::default - a small demo recipe
